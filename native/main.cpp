// Dawn and wgpu-native do not agree yet on the lifetime management
// of objects. We align on Dawn convention of calling "release" the
// methods that free memory for objects created with wgpuCreateSomething.
// (The key difference is that Dawn also offers a "reference" function to
// increment a reference counter, and release decreases this counter and
// actually frees memory only when the counter gets to 0)
